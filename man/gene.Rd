\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing all relevant data.}

\item{factor.structure}{A list linking factors to items. The names of the list elements correspond to the factor names. Each list element must contain a character-vector of item names that are indicators of this factor.}

\item{capacity}{A list containing the number of items per subtest. This must be in the same order as the \code{factor.structure} provided. If a single number, it is applied to all subtests. If \code{NULL} all items are evenly distributed among the subtests.}

\item{item.weights}{A placeholder. Currently all weights are assumed to be one.}

\item{item.invariance}{A character vector of length 1 or the same length as \code{factor.structure} containing the desired invariance levels between items pertaining to the same subtest. Currently there are five options: 'congeneric', 'ess.equivalent', 'ess.parallel', 'equivalent', and 'parallel', the first being the default.}

\item{repeated.measures}{A list linking factors that are repeated measures of each other. Repeated factors must be in one element of the list - other sets of factors in other elements of the list. When this is \code{NULL} (the default) a cross-sectional model is estimated.}

\item{long.invariance}{A character vector of length 1 or the same length as \code{repeated.measures} containing the longitudinal invariance level of repeated items. Currently there are four options: 'configural', 'weak', 'strong', and 'strict'. Defaults to 'strict'. When \code{repeated.measures=NULL} this argument is ignored.}

\item{mtmm}{A list linking factors that are measurements of the same construct with different methods. Measurements of the same construct must be in one element of the list - other sets of methods in other elements of the list. When this is \code{NULL} (the default) a single method model is estimated.}

\item{mtmm.invariance}{A character vector of length 1 or the same length as \code{mtmm} containing the invariance level of MTMM items. Currently there are five options: 'none', 'configural', 'weak', 'strong', and 'strict'. Defaults to 'configural'. With 'none' differing items are allowed for different methods. When \code{mtmm=NULL} this argument is ignored.}

\item{grouping}{The name of the grouping variable. The grouping variable must be part of \code{data} provided and must be a numeric variable.}

\item{group.invariance}{A single value describing the assumed invariance of items across groups. Currently there are four options: 'configural', 'weak', 'strong', and 'strict'. Defaults to 'strict'. When \code{grouping=NULL} this argument is ignored.}

\item{auxiliary}{The names of auxiliary variables in \code{data}. These can be used in additional modeling steps that may be provided in \code{analysis.options$model}.}

\item{use.order}{A logical indicating whether or not to take the selection order of the items into account. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{software}{The name of the estimation software. Can currently be 'lavaan' (the default) or 'Mplus'. Each option requires the software to be installed.}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to be used in parallel processing. If \code{NULL} (the default) the result of \code{\link[parallel]{detectCores}} will be used. On Unix-y machines parallel processing is implemented via \code{\link[parallel]{mclapply}}, on Windows machines it is realized via \code{\link[parallel]{parLapply}}.}

\item{objective}{A function that converts the results of model estimation into a pheromone. See 'details' for... details.}

\item{ignore.errors}{A logical indicating whether or not to ignore estimation problems (such as non positive-definite latent covariance matrices). Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{generations}{Maximum number of generations to run. Defaults to 128.}

\item{individuals}{The number of individuals per generation. Defaults to 64.}

\item{elitism}{The proportion of individuals from the last generation to carry over to the next generation. Defaults to 1/individuals, meaning that the best individual is retained into the next generation.}

\item{reproduction}{The proportion of individuals that are allowed to sire offspring. These individuals are selected using fitness proportionate selection. Defaults to .5.}

\item{mutation}{The mutation probability. Defaults to .1. See 'details'.}

\item{mating.index}{The relative rank of the selected mate within the mating pool. A number bewteen 0, indicating a best-last mating, and 1 (the default), indicating a best-first mating. See 'details'.}

\item{mating.size}{The proportion of potential mates sampled from the pool of reproducers for each selected individual. Defaults to .25. See 'details'.}

\item{mating.criterion}{The criterion by which to select mates. Can be either 'similarity' or 'fitness' (the default). See 'details'.}

\item{tolerance}{The tolerance for deteriming convergence. Defaults to .0001. See 'details'.}

\item{analysis.options}{A list additional arguments to be passed to the estimation software. The names of list elements must correspond to the arguments changed in the respective estimation software. E.g. \code{analysis.options$model} can contain additional modeling commands - such as regressions on auxiliary variables.}

\item{suppress.model}{A logical indicating whether to suppress the default model generation. If \code{TRUE} a model must be provided in \code{analysis.options$model}.}

\item{seed}{A random seed for the generation of random samples. See \code{\link{Random}} for more details.}

\item{filename}{The stem of the filenames used to save inputs, outputs, and data files when \code{software='Mplus'}. This may include the file path. When \code{NULL} (the default) files will be saved to the temporary directory, which is deleted when the R session is ended.}

\description{
Construct subtests from a given pool of items using a simple genetic algorithm. Allows for multiple constructs, occasions, and groups.
}
\details{
The pheromone function provided via \code{objective} is used to assess the quality of the solutions. These functions can contain any combination of the fit indices provided by the estimation software. When using Mplus these fit indices are 'rmsea', 'srmr', 'cfi', 'tli', 'chisq' (with 'df' and 'pvalue'), 'aic', 'bic', and 'abic'. With lavaan any fit index provided by \code{\link[lavaan]{inspect}} can be used. Additionally 'crel' provides an aggregate of composite reliabilites, 'rel' provides a vector or a list of reliability coefficients for the latent variables, 'con' provides an aggregate consistency estimate for MTMM analyses, and 'lvcor' provides a list of the latent variable correlation matrices. For more detailed objective functions 'lambda', 'theta', 'psi', and 'alpha' provide the model-implied matrices. Per default a pheromone function using 'crel', 'rmsea', and 'srmr' is used. Please be aware that the \code{objective} must be a function with the required fit indices as (correctly named) arguments.

The genetic algorithm implemented selects parents in a two-step procedure. First, a fitness proportionate selection is performed to select \code{inviduals} times \code{reproduction} viable parents. Then, the non-self-adaptive version of mating proposed by Gal√°n, Mengshoel, and Pinter (2013) is used to perform mating. In contrast to the original article, the \code{mating.index} and \code{mating.size} are handled as proportions, not integers. Similarity-based mating is based on the Jaccard Similarity. Mutation is currently always handled as an exchange of the selection state between two items. This results in mutation selecting one item that was not selected prior to mutation and dropping one item selected prior to mutation. Convergence is checked via the variance of the global-best values on the objective function, as proposed by Bhandari, Murthy, and Pal (2012). To avoid false convergence in the early search, the lower of either 10\% of the generations or 10 generations must be completed, before convergence is checked. For generalizability over different functions provided to \code{objective}, these are scaled to the first global-best found.
