\title{STUART: Subtests Using Algorithmic Rummaging Techniques}
\description{
The STUART-Package automates the generation of subtests from
a given set of items within the confines of confirmatory factor analysis.
}
\section{Functionality}{


Using this package subtests can be generated in four different ways: using a pseudo-random approach rooted in Ant-Colony-Optimization via the \code{\link{mmas}}-function, using a simple genetic algorithm via the \code{\link{gene}}-function, using a brute-force approach via the aptly named \code{\link{bruteforce}}-function, or by random chance, using the \code{\link{randomsamples}}-function.

Addtionally, there are some convenience functions which are more or less useful. The \code{\link{combinations}}-function can be used to determine the number of possible subtests to inform a decision on which selection approach to use. The \code{\link{crossvalidate}}-function can be used to evaluate the quality of a selection in a different (sub-)sample. To add to this functionality, the \code{\link{holdout}}-function randomly splits the data into a calibration and a validation sample. The entire process can be applied to k samples with \code{\link{kfold}}. The \code{\link{heuristics}}-function can be used to extract the formatting of heuristic matrices which can be provided to the \code{\link{mmas}}-function.

As of version 0.10.0 this package also includes some convenience functions for handling objective functions. These are mainly \code{\link{fixedobjective}} - to generate a fixed objective function containing any number of a variety of possible quality criteria - and \code{\link{empiricalobjective}} - to generate an adaptive objective function based on the quality determined for previous solution on any such criteria. In addition \code{\link{objectivematrices}} provides functionality to extract matrices for situations in which, for example, latent correlations or regressions predicting distal outcomes are included into the selection procedure.

The package also provides three datasets to try things out with: \code{\link{fairplayer}}, \code{\link{sia}}, and \code{\link{sups}}.
